Noise generator is a script that quickly generate a mesh with increasingly smaller details using perlin noise.
It has multiple settings to manage certain aspects of the terrain such as it's number of vertices, amount of detail, height amplitude, etc...
All the computation is done on the CPU, and as such is compatable with any platform.
It is not the most performant solution, but it is the easiest to use.
